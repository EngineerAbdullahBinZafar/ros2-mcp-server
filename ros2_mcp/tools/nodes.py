MCP Tools for ROS2 Node introspection.

Fix BUG-11: get_node_info previously used a case-insensitive substring match
on the string representation of the entire topic dict — which could match
a node name appearing anywhere in any value (including unrelated fields).

Now uses proper ROS2 naming: exact match on the node name component
extracted from the (name, namespace) tuples returned by list_nodes().
